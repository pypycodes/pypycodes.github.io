introduction: |

This is a work-log of all the work-arounds, how-tos, fixes and issues that I have faced or occured during my work. I mainly work on Automation and DevOps Tool sets with exposure to cloud environments. I try to maintain an architect's daily diary for community building and to keep a place that I can visit back when needed.
