## Hello Readers

Thank you for taking the time to read my blog. I work as a Solutions Architect focusing on Automation, DevOps, and AWS Cloud. This blog serves as my daily log, where I share my learnings, discoveries, and interesting topics or viewpoints as an Architect. You can connect with me via email or LinkedIn using the footer links. I am an avid DILBERT FAN, that explains the favicon or the blog image :)

## Why host on GitHub and not Medium or similar blogging websites?

I believe content is more important than the hosting platform. While platforms like Medium offer flexibility and a broader audience, hosting on GitHub Pages is easy and less demanding. It is also distraction-free, ad-free, and clean, focusing solely on the content.

With GitHub Pages, I can experiment and create impactful content.

## Why use a pseudonym for the blog and the GitHub repo?

I am a die-hard coder and have always been passionate about coding, so the name "pypycodes" resonates with that essence.
